License:

TawfeekCMS is provided under a Dual-Licensing Model. A Community Free Open Source version, and a commercial one. The public repository hosted on Github is the Community one, while the commercial release can be purchased/requested and required about from sales[@]codernix[.]com.

TawfeekCMS may use and borrow code from other Open Source projects in forms of Frameworks and/or Libraries, hence we recommend the users to check the components used in the project if they have any incompatibily issues with the available Open Source Licenses out there. For more info please contact legal[@]tawfeekcms[.]com.

========
Status:

Although the CMS can be deployed on production servers and can fulfill its functional requirements that serve most of the customers' needs already, it's still Tagged as Alpha for its development Roadmap's milestones, which will keep evolving by time to meet the final vision it was designed for, and precisely the on-going writing of more core classes, the re-architecture of the DB class alongside the others, and the evolution of its API.

The development, testing, fixing, and upgrading of the software is handled in an Agile model, thus it is released and will always be provided during its various phases of advancement allowing the users/developers/contributors to stay in close contact before the cycle hits its Features-Freeze stage, which will help the cause of strengthening the earlier Feedback-Response relationship among the involved parties to shape the future of the CMS and improve its Code Quality.

========
Usage:

TawfeekCMS can be used for General Purpose projects as well as Bespoke ones, that need less generic features, and for this aforementioned reason TawfeekCMS was designed so that it can be stripped of any main or extra module without affecting its performance or causing regressions or breaking its functionality. Please refer to the documentation to differenciate between the core, main, and extra modules, and what they stand for.

If you wish to keep the changes you've done private, and you don't wish to share your work upstream, then TawfeekCMS provides you the option to by acquiring it under the commercial license instead. You can contact sales[@]codernix[.]com to request a price quote and study your available options.
